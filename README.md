# Distributed Computing Framework
Under construction

## Get Started

## TODO
- Define a dynamic way to access the processed data
- Read about and implement byzantine fault tolerance? Look into replication or other techniques
- Allow the user to give a heuristic for calculation difficulty of a piece of data. Can be used for load distribution? (read about load distribution)


## Better definitions
Server :
* Who is connected
    - Monitor disconnects
    - Monitor craches 
* Who is doing what work
    - List of client
    - The work load of each client
    - Estimation of Response times?
* How much work needs to be done
    - Construct total workload
    - Deligate workload
