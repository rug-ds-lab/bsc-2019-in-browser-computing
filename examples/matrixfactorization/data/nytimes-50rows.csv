"Stocks failed to extend last week's rally yesterday as oil rose the most this month and inflation concerns spurred investors to sell shares of retailers, the market's best performers in September. Home Depot, the home improvement chain, led the Dow Jones industrial average lower after Credit Suisse cut its rating, citing potential earnings shortfalls because of a housing slowdown.",2006-09-19 00:00:00,"4fd253108eb7c8105d7f95d3","http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/19/business/19stox.html"
"LEAD: Because of an editing error, the Prospects column last week mistakenly added a phrase to the comments of Edward S. Hyman, vice chairman of C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc., on the course of inflation. The sentence containing his prediction should have read: ''This means that by late 1990 inflation will be back down to 3 percent.",1989-04-02 00:00:00,"4fd1831d8eb7c8105d68063f","http://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/02/business/c-correction-716089.html"
"Inflation eased, reflecting the pressure on prices of ample supplies of oil. As measured by the Consumer Price Index, the inflation rate in March slowed to a gain of 7.2 percent on an annual basis, the lowest since last summer. In February the increase at an annual rate was 12 percent. Gains in food prices moderated.",1981-04-26 00:00:00,"4fd1187c8eb7c8105d5d046e","http://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/26/business/the-week-in-business-an-easing-in-inflation.html"

"''HOW sweet it is!'' drawled V. Earl Dickinson, a state legislator from Mineral, Va. This November, unlike two years ago, and two years before that, Mr. Dickinson faces no opposition. In fact, in his 26 years in office, he has never seen voters so ''really happy.'' ''I keep on going to the funerals, going to the weddings and showing up at all the different places,'' the 73-year-old Democrat said. ''But the pressure is not there, so I can sit back.''",1997-08-31 00:00:00,"4fd1d5378eb7c8105d712f32","http://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/31/weekinreview/when-good-news-is-bad-for-politics.html"
"Inventories of goods jumped six-tenths of a percent in February, the biggest increase in five months, the Commerce Department reported today. A buildup of unsold goods can herald an economic slowdown, but in this case economists were not concerned. Business sales also posted a strong rise, eight-tenths of a percent, for the best gain in three months.",1998-04-16 00:00:00,"4fd1fb818eb7c8105d759db1","http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/16/business/rise-in-inventories-is-biggest-in-five-months.html"
"Reporting that the German economy was driving itself out of deep recession, a group of leading economic research institutes significantly increased projections today for economic growth this year and predicted that the output of Europe's largest economy would rise further in 1995. But the forecast of strong growth did not stop the German stock and bond markets from falling. Touched off by fears of renewed inflation in the United States and continuing weakness in the dollar, stocks on the benchmark DAX index fell 2.51 percent and bonds had one of their worst days in weeks.",1994-10-26 00:00:00,"4fd1c70e8eb7c8105d6f852a","http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/26/business/germans-see-growth-markets-drop-anyway.html"
"Like millions of other homeowners, William D. Compton would like to refinance his mortgage so that he pays less each month for his three-bedroom house in Gulf Breeze, Fla. With the savings, he figures he could afford a few extra movies and restaurant dinners or he could buy a new stove and brakes for his car, purchases he has postponed because finances are so tight. Although he would appear to be a good candidate, Mr. Compton, 57, has been turned down twice for a federal refinancing program aimed at homeowners like him.",2011-11-30 00:00:00,"4fd292e88eb7c8105d86c8ba","http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/30/business/us-widens-scope-of-mortgage-refinancing-program.html"
"IN my mind, there are two lessons from the Supreme Court's 5-to-4 decision to support President Obama's health care plan: 1) how starved the country is for leadership that puts the nation's interest before partisan politics, which is exactly what Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. did; and 2) the virtue of audacity in politics and thinking big. Let's look at both. It was not surprising to hear liberals extolling the legal creativity and courage of Chief Justice Roberts in finding a way to greenlight Obama's Affordable Care Act. But there is something deeper reflected in that praise, and it even touched some conservatives. It's the feeling that it has been so long since a national leader ''surprised'' us. It's the feeling that it has been so long since a national leader ripped up the polls and not only acted out of political character but did so truly for the good of the country -- as Chief Justice Roberts seemingly did.",2012-06-30 00:00:00,"50007d5f1c22dfde670af04b","http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/opinion/sunday/taking-one-for-the-country.html"
