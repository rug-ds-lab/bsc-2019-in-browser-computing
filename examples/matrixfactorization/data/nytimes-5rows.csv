"At Hostos Community College in the South Bronx, located in what the 2000 census found to be the nation's poorest Congressional district, 176 people have applied to study nursing this year, up from 135 in 2007.

"WASHINGTON -- Companies spend millions of dollars each year complaining to Congress about burdensome laws and regulations, pressing their concerns in public campaigns and in private meetings. They rarely wait for invitations.

"President Reagan today raised the question of whether the Federal Reserve Board should be placed under the authority of the Treasury Secretary. Answering questions at a political campaign appearance, Mr. Reagan said that in the past several weeks the Federal Reserve had been working well. But when the central bank was established, he noted, the Secretary of Treasury was its head, and he asked whether someone should reconsider whether such a system might work better than the current one.

"When flight attendants were ordered by their union to cross the picket lines at Pan American World Airways last week it was further evidence that the strike, long regarded as labor's ultimate weapon, has lost much of its power in recent years. It was the second blow to the Transport Workers' Union, which called a strike on Feb. 28. The union, representing more than 5,000 baggage handlers, flight dispatchers and food service workers, demanded higher wages and better working conditions. But Pan Am, which has not had a profitable year since 1980, sought employee ''give-backs.'' A week after the strike shut down most of the airline's operations, the pilots' union broke ranks, reaching a back-to-work settlement with Pan Am.",1985-03-24 00:00:00,"4fd14c338eb7c8105d62abf5","http://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/24/weekinreview/why-walkouts-don-t-work-as-they-used-to.html"
"THE escalation of violence in the Middle East is undermining investor confidence that the recovering economy will lead to higher stock prices.
